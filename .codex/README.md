# Codex Harness

This directory holds the project-scoped Codex configuration for Grind in Public. Codex reads its repository rules from
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), so no Codex-specific instruction file exists; see the
[agent harness support policy](../repo-governance/conventions/agent-harness-support.md).

## Contents

- `config.toml` — project settings. Codex loads this layer only for a trusted project, and it takes precedence over the
  user config.
- `hooks.json` — the `PreToolUse` hook that announces the rule-change workflows before an `apply_patch`, `Edit`, or
  `Write` edit. Codex runs a project hook only after the owner trusts the project and approves the hook with `/hooks`;
  see [harness pre-edit triggers](../repo-governance/development/harness-pre-edit-triggers.md).
- [`agents/`](agents/README.md) — the shared subagents available in this repository.

Codex discovers agents from `agents/*.toml` without registration, and ignores other file types there.

Codex skills live outside this directory, in [`.agents/skills/`](../.agents/skills/README.md), because that is where
Codex reads them.

Codex supports no project command directory, so this harness has no `commands/` and is exempt from that capability's
count; see the [harness capability parity policy](../repo-governance/conventions/harness-capability-parity-policy.md).
