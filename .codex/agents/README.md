# Codex Subagents

Codex discovers these agents automatically from this directory. It reads only `*.toml` here, so this README is ignored.

## Available Agents

- [`drill-reviewer.toml`](drill-reviewer.toml) — reviews a finished practice drill for correctness, complexity, edge
  cases, and explanation quality. Use it after solving an exercise by hand, when you want feedback rather than an
  answer; it never writes the solution.
- [`repo-explorer.toml`](repo-explorer.toml) — read-only explorer that reports where code, tests, documentation, and
  governance rules live. Use it to locate things or check which rule applies before making a change; it never edits
  anything.

Each role is mirrored in [`.claude/agents/`](../../.claude/agents/README.md) and
[`.opencode/agents/`](../../.opencode/agents/README.md) and must stay at parity; see the
[harness capability parity policy](../../repo-governance/conventions/harness-capability-parity-policy.md).
