# Specifications

This directory describes what this repository's software should do. Specs state intent and observable behavior; `apps/` and `libs/` state how that behavior is delivered.

The tree mirrors the workspace — `specs/apps/<name>/` and `specs/libs/<name>/` — and each subject carries a `behavior/` folder of Gherkin scenarios plus whatever `product/`, `system-context/`, `containers/`, or `components/` detail it genuinely needs.

For the structure, the Gherkin cardinality rule, and when specs are required, read the [specs policy](../repo-governance/development/specs-policy.md). For how scenarios bind to tests, read the [TDD policy](../repo-governance/development/tdd-policy.md) and the [BDD policy](../repo-governance/development/behavior-driven-development-policy.md).

## Current Specifications

- [Badak Mini](apps/badakmini-cli/README.md) has an executable five-feature corpus. Unit, local integration, and public-process E2E adapters recursively consume it and fail when a feature, step, binding, or adapter drifts.
