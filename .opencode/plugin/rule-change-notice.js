/**
 * Announces the rule-change workflows before opencode edits a rule file.
 *
 * The Git pre-commit hook is the guaranteed trigger for every tool. This plugin
 * moves the same notice earlier in an opencode session, so the workflow is read
 * while the change is still being written rather than once it is staged.
 *
 * The notice comes from the repository's own rule-change script rather than
 * from a copy of the rule paths kept here, because a second list would drift
 * from the one the other harnesses and the pre-commit hook use.
 *
 * It only reports. Blocking an edit here would put a rule in a config file,
 * which the agent harness support policy forbids.
