# Repository Governance

This directory contains shared repository governance for human contributors and AI agents.

## Related Entry Points

- [Repository README](../README.md) — the human project overview. Use it for repository purpose, setup, and human-facing
  navigation.
- [Documentation Hub](../docs/README.md) — human Diátaxis documentation. Use it when the task is learning, reference,
  explanation, or a how-to procedure.
- [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) — concise instructions for coding agents. Use it at the start of repository work before
  loading focused governance below.

## Directory Index

- [Governance Conventions](conventions/README.md) — shared standards for repository content and practices. Use them when
  creating or reviewing work covered by a convention.
- [Development Governance](development/README.md) — policies for code, testing, hooks, Nx, and validation. Use it when
  changing executable code or tooling.
- [Documentation Index Policy](documentation-index-policy.md) — README and metadata requirements for repository
  documents. Use it when adding, moving, or maintaining Markdown under `docs/`, `repo-governance/`, `scripts/`, or a
  harness directory.
- [Governance Principles](principles/README.md) — foundations every policy and workflow must follow. Use them before
  resolving a governance conflict.
- [Repository Workflows](workflows/README.md) — repeatable repository procedures. Use the relevant workflow whenever a
  task has a defined process.

## Delivery Directories

- [Plans](../plans/README.md) — the working record of change, staged from idea to archive. Use it when planning,
  executing, or reviewing a piece of work.
- [Specifications](../specs/README.md) — Gherkin behavior and as-built application architecture. Use it when changing
  what the software does or its documented boundaries.

## Gate History

Each [rules-quality-gate](workflows/rules-quality-gate.md) run appends one line to
`local-tmp/gate-history/rules-quality-gate.md`, which is untracked. The
[findings report](workflows/rules-quality-gate/05-findings-report.md) owns what a run records and what an open finding
requires.

## How to Use This Directory

- Keep `AGENTS.md` concise and link it to shared governance that agents need.
- Put detailed shared rules, workflows, and specialized policies here.
- Link to a governance document from the appropriate human or agent entry point when it becomes required for a recurring
  task or a specific area.
- Read the smallest relevant set of documents; do not load unrelated guidance.

## Document Conventions

Name each document as the [document naming policy](conventions/document-naming-policy.md) requires. Group related
documents into a subdirectory — `conventions/` for stable shared standards, `development/` for code, testing, Nx, hook,
and validation policies, `principles/` for foundational rules, and `workflows/` for repeatable procedures.

Each document should state its scope, give actionable rules, and link to any source-of-truth files or commands. Avoid
duplicating `AGENTS.md`; keep shared rules there and move only extended context here.

## Maintaining the Guidance

Update the relevant document when a practice changes. If a detailed rule becomes universal or essential for every agent
task, summarize it in `AGENTS.md` and retain the full shared rationale here.
