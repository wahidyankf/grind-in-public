# Code Commentary Policy

## Purpose

This is a learning repository. Code should help a reader understand both what it does and the reasoning behind it,
including the owner returning to a drill months later.

## Required Commentary

Add purposeful comments to executable source, tests, and repository scripts. Explain decisions that are not obvious from
syntax alone, including:

- the intent and boundary of a module, function, or test;
- important control-flow stages and data transformations;
- invariants, security or correctness checks, and failure behaviour;
- why a dependency is injected, mocked, cached, or intentionally avoided; and
- non-obvious shell, Git, parsing, regular-expression, or library behaviour.

## Lint Enforcement

Each project owns the commentary checks in its `lint` target. TypeScript uses ESLint and `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` to
require complete-sentence summaries for named executable declarations; Go uses golangci-lint with Revive to document
exported declarations. Both require a specific, explained linter suppression.

These checks establish a minimum shape, not comment quality. They do not decide whether a private helper's reasoning is
worth explaining or whether a summary is true, useful, and current.

## What to Avoid

Do not narrate self-evident statements or duplicate a precise name. Prefer a short comment immediately before the
decision it explains. Keep comments true when code changes; stale explanations are defects.

Every `drill-reviewer` prompt states this requirement — comments that explain intent and non-obvious decisions, not
syntax narration — in the imperative, because a subagent prompt has to stand alone. Change it in the same edit, in all
three harness copies.

## Review

When adding or changing executable code, manually review the surrounding flow for the comments a learner would need to
reconstruct the reasoning. A passing linter never replaces that review. Keep configuration, generated artifacts,
lockfiles, and plain data free of explanatory noise unless their format supports and benefits from comments.
