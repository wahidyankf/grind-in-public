# Harness Pre-Edit Triggers

A pre-edit trigger says the same thing earlier, while the change is still being written. Support differs, and the
difference is recorded rather than assumed:

| Harness     | Pre-edit trigger                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `PreToolUse` on `Edit`, `Write`, and `NotebookEdit`, wired in `.claude/settings.json`; verified                                                                                                     |
| opencode    | `.opencode/plugin/rule-change-notice.js` on `tool.execute.before`; the plugin loads, firing is unverified here                                                                                      |
| Codex       | `PreToolUse` on `apply_patch`, `Edit`, and `Write`, wired in `.codex/hooks.json`; it runs only after the owner trusts the project and approves the hook with `/hooks`, so firing is unverified here |

Each harness asks Badak Mini for the notice rather than keeping its own copy of the rule paths, so the three cannot
drift apart: all of them call `harness rule-change hook`. The payloads differ and the command reads both, since Claude
Code names the file while Codex sends a patch whose file headers it parses.
