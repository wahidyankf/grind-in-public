# Nx Workspace Policy

## Scope

This policy applies whenever repository work adds or changes Nx configuration, targets, dependencies, generators, or
executors.

## Required Approach

Use Nx as a raw task runner. Define a target that owns one command with the `command` shorthand. Define an aggregate
that must run several existing targets in order with the built-in `nx:run-commands` executor, an explicit
`options.commands` list, and `options.parallel` set to `false`. Invoke the existing Nx target entry points from that
list instead of copying their underlying commands, so only the individual targets own those commands.

This policy owns how Nx may be used; the [testing policy](testing-policy.md) owns which targets a project exposes and
[Target Shape](testing-policy/target-shape.md) owns what each one declares. Read those before adding a target, rather
than inferring the convention from a neighbouring file.

Use ordinary, exact-pinned npm or language-native dependencies for compilation, testing, and execution. The built-in
command runner is not a technology plugin and does not justify adding an `@nx/*` package.

Do not add framework-, language-, or platform-specific Nx plugins; do not use plugin-specific generators or executors.
In particular, avoid adding direct `@nx/*` technology packages merely to scaffold or run a project.

## Exceptions

An exception requires explicit repository-owner direction that identifies the needed plugin and the capability it
provides. Record the decision in the change that introduces it, keep its dependency version exact, and run the full
locked dependency audit afterward.

## Verification

Run `rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm exec -- nx show projects` to confirm project discovery, then
run the affected Nx targets and `rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm audit --audit-level=low`.
Preserve `.nx/` and generated project build directories in `.gitignore`.
