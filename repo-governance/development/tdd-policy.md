# TDD Policy

## Scope

This policy covers how behavior gets implemented: test first, one scenario at a time. It applies to every change in
`apps/` and `libs/`, including Badak Mini, whose checks silently disable a repository gate when they are wrong.

## The Cycle

Each behavior starts Gherkin-first: add or update exactly one canonical scenario before its RED test, then deliver it as
a RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle:

1. **RED** — write the test that expresses the scenario, and run it. It must fail, and it must fail for the stated
   reason. A test that passes on first run tested nothing.
2. **GREEN** — write the smallest change that makes it pass. Not the elegant version; the passing version.
3. **REFACTOR** — improve the code with the test still passing. This step is where the design happens, and skipping it
   is how a suite of passing tests accumulates an unmaintainable implementation.

## One Scenario per Cycle

Every behavior cycle targets exactly one Gherkin scenario from the [specs policy](specs-policy.md). Its RED step names
the scenario and inlines the scenario verbatim as a fenced `gherkin` block, so the executor never has to open another
file to know what to assert.

```text
- [ ] [AI] RED — **Gherkin (binds)** "The app greets the configured name". Add the failing
      test to `apps/badakmini-cli/internal/rulechange/detect_test.go`. Verify with
      `npx nx run badakmini-cli:test:quick` — the new test fails. Scenario:

~~~gherkin
Scenario: The app greets the configured name
  Given the app is configured with the name "Wahidyan"
  When the app runs
  Then the output is "Hello, Wahidyan!"
~~~
```

The scenario fence sits at the left margin rather than inside the list item, because a fence indented into a list is
re-indented on every formatting pass and never settles.

Bundling several scenarios into one cycle hides which behavior a failure belongs to. Long checklists are the expected
outcome and are not a reason to merge cycles.

Pure data or calculation tests that underpin several scenarios use `**Gherkin (underpins)**` and may name a list.

Every `plan-checker` prompt states this rule in the imperative, because a subagent prompt has to stand alone. Change it
in the same edit, in all three harness copies.

## Regression Tests

See [TDD Policy Details](tdd-policy/README.md).

## Verification

`test:quick` and `test:integration` run the resulting tests, per the [testing policy](testing-policy.md). `plan-checker`
flags a RED step that inlines no scenario or names more than one, and a `prd.md` scenario that no RED step inlines,
because its rule 4 runs in both directions. Behavior that reaches neither document escapes it, and whether a RED step
truly failed first holds by review.
