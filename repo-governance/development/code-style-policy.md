# Code Style Policy

## Scope

This policy covers how source code is written: the language target, naming, indentation, imports, and language-native formatting. Prettier is the source of truth for the file types it supports, and the [Markdown style policy](../conventions/markdown-style-policy.md) covers prose. What a comment must explain belongs to the [code commentary policy](code-commentary-policy.md).

## Language Target

Use strict TypeScript with CommonJS-compatible Node output. Badak Mini is the Go CLI for repository-local validation; follow the [Badak Mini policy](badakmini-cli-policy.md) before extending it.

## Naming and Layout

TypeScript uses two-space indentation, `camelCase` variables and functions, `PascalCase` classes, and descriptive lower-hyphenated file names.

Go uses `gofumpt` and `goimports` as enforced by the project lint target. Follow Go's idiomatic `MixedCaps` naming, keep package names short and lowercase, and use lowercase file names with underscores only when they improve grouping. Do not hand-format code in a style the configured formatters will replace.

A descriptive file name is one a reader can act on without opening the file. `parse-project-file.ts` says what it holds; `utils.ts` says only that someone had nowhere to put it.

## Imports

Import internal TypeScript libraries by package name, not by relative cross-project paths. A relative path across a project boundary compiles, so nothing stops it, and it hides the dependency from Nx — which then cannot tell that the importing project is affected when the imported one changes.

Let `goimports` group and order Go imports. The [Badak Mini policy](badakmini-cli-policy.md) owns its production dependency boundary; tool dependencies in its Go module do not authorize runtime imports.

## Verification

```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Linting and type checking catch the mechanical part. Naming is reviewed by a person, because a name is only wrong relative to what the code does.
