# Specs Policy

## Scope

This policy covers `specs/`, the repository's description of what its software should do. Specs state intent and observable behavior; `apps/` and `libs/` state how that behavior is delivered. Keeping them apart means a behavior discussion can start from one source of truth instead of from an implementation.

## Structure

Specs mirror the workspace: `specs/apps/<name>/` and `specs/libs/<name>/`. Each carries the folders its subject actually needs, and no others:

```text
specs/apps/<name>/
+-- README.md          index for this subject
+-- product/           the problem, its users, and scope
+-- system-context/    the boundary with the outside world
+-- containers/        the running parts
+-- components/        the internals of a part
+-- behavior/          Gherkin acceptance scenarios
```

`behavior/` is the only mandatory folder. Add another when the subject is complex enough to need it, not in advance.

## Gherkin

Acceptance criteria are written as Gherkin scenarios in `.feature` files under `behavior/`.

A scenario uses exactly one primary `Given`, one `When`, and one `Then`; further steps chain with `And` or `But`. A `Background` block and a `Scenario Outline` `Examples` table are exempt. Two `When` steps in one scenario describe two behaviors, so split them.

```gherkin
Feature: Greeting

  Scenario: The app greets the configured name
    Given the app is configured with the name "Wahidyan"
    When the app runs
    Then the output is "Hello, Wahidyan!"
```

Every `plan-checker` prompt states this cardinality rule in the imperative, because a subagent prompt has to stand alone. Change it in the same edit, in all three harness copies.

## Binding to Tests

A scenario is not documentation: it binds to a test that fails when the behavior breaks, as the [TDD policy](tdd-policy.md) requires. A scenario with no test behind it is worse than no scenario, because it claims coverage that does not exist.

## When Specs Are Required

A plan that adds or changes behavior in `apps/` or `libs/` writes the scenarios into its `prd.md` and lands them in `specs/` as part of delivery. Every existing app and library has executable Gherkin under its mirrored `behavior/` directory; a missing corpus is a policy failure, not deferred retrofit work. Drills are exempt: a drill is practice, not repository behavior.

## Verification

Each subject's behavior gate recursively discovers its corpus, rejects malformed features, and fails for undefined, ambiguous, or unused bindings. It also proves every required adapter consumes the same catalog, so adding, editing, renaming, nesting, or deleting a feature or binding cannot silently bypass verification. `plan-checker` additionally verifies that a plan's Gherkin follows the cardinality rule above and that every planned scenario is represented by a RED step.
