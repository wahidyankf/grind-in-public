# Question Tools

Each supported harness exposes one tool for a structured question:

| Harness     | Tool                 | Notes                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `AskUserQuestion`    | Verified here. The harness appends a free-text entry, which serves as the Rule 8 write-in.                                                    |
| Codex       | `request_user_input` | Needs `default_mode_request_user_input` in `.codex/config.toml`; Codex marks the feature as in development, so its effect is unverified here. |
| opencode    | `question`           | Documented by opencode; unverified here.                                                                                                      |

A tool that returns a structured choice removes the parsing step, which is why Rule 6 prefers it over prose. Only a
session with no such tool falls back to [Markdown](markdown-fallback.md).
