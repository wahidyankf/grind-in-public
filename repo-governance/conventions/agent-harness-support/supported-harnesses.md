# Supported Harnesses

| Harness     | Instructions read                        | Project config          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` only, with no fallback       | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Codex       | `AGENTS.md`                              | `.codex/config.toml`    |
| opencode    | `AGENTS.md`, falling back to `CLAUDE.md` | `opencode.json`         |

Where each harness loads its subagents, skills, and commands belongs to the
[harness capability parity policy](../harness-capability-parity-policy.md).
