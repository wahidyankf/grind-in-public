# Agent Harness Support Policy

## Scope

This repository supports three harnesses, in the sense the [agent vocabulary](agent-vocabulary.md) defines: the tool
that runs the model. `AGENTS.md` is the sole repository-rule body. Codex and opencode read it directly; Claude Code
reaches it through the exact `@AGENTS.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Details

Read the table the task needs rather than the whole policy:

- [Supported Harnesses](agent-harness-support/supported-harnesses.md) — the instruction file and project config each
  harness reads.
- [Directory Index Behaviour](agent-harness-support/directory-index-behaviour.md) — what each registering harness
  directory does with a `README.md`.

## Rules

Do not create a `CODEX.md` or `OPENCODE.md`. Both tools read `AGENTS.md` already, and a third instruction file would add
a copy to keep aligned for no gain. Add an instruction file only when its harness cannot read `AGENTS.md`, and then
follow the [agent instruction alignment policy](agent-instruction-alignment-policy.md).

The [harness capability parity policy](harness-capability-parity-policy.md) owns the capability directories, the parity
requirement, and the check that enforces it.

Keep each project config to settings that the tool documents and that the repository actually needs. A config file is
not a place for rules; rules belong in `AGENTS.md` or `repo-governance/`. Do not re-list an auto-discovered file as an
extra instruction; `opencode.json` therefore pins only its schema.

Write every agent description as two things: a short statement of what the agent does, then a short sentence saying when
it should be used. Harnesses route work by description, so an agent that omits its trigger will be picked at the wrong
time or never. Keep the wording equivalent across formats.

Index a harness directory with a `README.md`, as the [documentation index policy](../documentation-index-policy.md)
requires, and update it in the same change that adds, renames, or removes a file there. Which directories register a
file by name, and what each does with an index, is recorded in
[directory index behaviour](agent-harness-support/directory-index-behaviour.md).

A permission control that one harness lacks is recorded in the canonical definition, the native mapping, and the
supported-harness table. Codex has no per-agent shell switch, so its read-only explorer combines `sandbox_mode` with the
canonical instruction instead of pretending that an unavailable native control exists.

## Verification

Run the [Harness Alignment](../workflows/harness-alignment.md) workflow after changing any instruction file, harness
config, or subagent. Test a new tool's discovery behaviour yourself before relying on it, because support changes
between releases.
