# Delivery Checklists

`delivery.md` is executed by an agent reading it literally. Every checkbox must therefore be unambiguous on its own,
without reconstructing intent from the rest of the plan.

The dated log `delivery.md` opens with is a separate artifact with its own rules;
[execution record](execution-record.md) owns it.

## One Action per Checkbox

One checkbox equals one concrete, independently verifiable action. The test: can this item be verified done without
completing anything else on the list? If not, split it. Multi-step work hidden behind one checkbox makes progress
invisible and makes "done" arguable.

## Execution-Grade Clarity

Each checkbox carries every element that applies:

- **The file path**, exactly, when it is known. When a new file's location is implementation-dependent, give the parent
  directory, the naming pattern, and a sibling to imitate.
- **The command**, verbatim — `npx nx run badakmini-cli:test:quick`, not "run the tests".
- **An acceptance criterion** stating the observable outcome that proves it done. No bare "implement", "set up", or
  "configure". A criterion satisfied by finding nothing — an empty output, a zero count — pairs that with a check
  proving the command looked at something real, and a criterion reading a tool's own output names a command whose output
  no shell wrapper rewrites.
- **Relevant `[AC-…]` labels** that trace the work to `prd.md`; a purely mechanical task carries none only when it
  cannot implement or prove an acceptance criterion.
- **One Gherkin scenario** per behaviour cycle, inlined verbatim, as the [TDD policy](../../development/tdd-policy.md)
  requires.

Bad, because it names no file, no command, and no observable outcome:

```markdown
- [ ] Add caching
```

Good:

```markdown
- [ ] [AI] Edit `apps/badakmini-cli/internal/rulechange/detect.go`: preserve one rule-change path after normalization.
      Verify with `npx nx run badakmini-cli:test:quick` — the suite exits 0.
```

## Executor Tags

Every checkbox states who can execute it. The tags are `[AI]`, `[HUMAN]`, and `[AI+HUMAN]`, matching `ose-public` so a
migrated plan needs no translation.

- **`[AI]`** — an agent can fully perform it. Write the tag out even here: an untagged checkbox is a defect, not an
  `[AI]` one.
- **`[HUMAN]`** — only the owner: physical actions, out-of-band approvals, anything needing real credentials an agent
  must not hold, and any step the owner is doing by hand to learn it.
- **`[AI+HUMAN]`** — an agent prepares, the owner approves or performs the irreversible step.

Tag toward `[AI]`. Git-mechanical steps such as committing, pushing, or moving a plan folder are `[AI]` unless a
specific reason says otherwise. A `delivery.md` opens with a one-line legend naming the three tags, so a reader meets
them before the first checkbox.

Recovery or rollback work names its trigger and remains dormant until triggered, and that trigger is read against its
wording rather than against the presence of a failure. During final reconciliation, a dormant item receives a dated,
evidence-backed `Not triggered` disposition instead of a false completion mark.

The [plan quality gate](../../workflows/plan-quality-gate.md) checks one action per checkbox, execution-grade clarity,
and the executor-tag legend during its semantic audit.
