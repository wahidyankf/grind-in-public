# Five-Document Structure

Every plan uses five core documents. Each owns one concern, so a reader looking for the technical approach never has to skim the rationale.

```text
plans/<stage>/<identifier>/
+-- README.md        overview, scope, links to the rest
+-- brd.md           why this matters
+-- prd.md           what it must do, in user stories and Gherkin
+-- tech-docs/       how it is built; a mapped technical set
|   +-- README.md    technical entry point and map
|   +-- file-impact.md
|   +-- ...          conditional companion documents
+-- delivery.md      the phased checklist that drives execution
+-- learnings.md     (transient) running log, drained before archival
+-- evidence/        (optional) command output and artifacts referenced from delivery.md
```

## What Each File Owns

**`README.md`** — context, scope with affected projects named explicitly, a summary of the approach, and links to the other four. It is the first file opened and the first file `plan-checker` reads for scope.

**`brd.md`** — the business rationale: why the work is worth doing, who it affects, what success means, business-level non-goals, and the risks. In a personal repository the "business" is the owner's own goals, so write real reasoning and label a judgment call as one. Never invent a metric to fill a heading.

**`prd.md`** — product requirements: user stories in `As a … I want … So that …` form and acceptance criteria in Gherkin, per the [specs policy](../../development/specs-policy.md). In-scope and out-of-scope features live here.

**`tech-docs/README.md`** — the technical entry point: context, architecture, selected decisions, dependencies, risks, reading order, and links to each companion. It owns no checklist. Every non-archived plan has `file-impact.md`, listing every expected path exactly as `[E]` edit, `[N]` new, `[M]` moved, or `[D]` deleted. Add the applicable companion documents named by the [specification-change](specification-changes.md), [migration](plan-migrations.md), and [UI-design](plan-ui-design.md) rules; do not create an empty companion.

**`delivery.md`** — the phased, ticked checklist that execution reads and `plan-checker` verifies; see [delivery checklists](delivery-checklists.md).

**`learnings.md`** — the transient running log described in [knowledge capture](knowledge-capture.md).

## No Single-File Exception

An owner-requested plan uses all five core documents. Do not delete or skip a requested plan because its size appears small; ask the owner whether to amend or cancel it instead.

Every `plan-checker` prompt names these documents and requires all five in the imperative, because a subagent prompt has to stand alone. Change them in the same edit, in all three harness copies.
