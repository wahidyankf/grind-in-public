# Grilling-With-Options Policy

## Scope

This policy governs how an agent questions the owner to resolve an open decision, adapted from the `ose-public` convention of the same name. It does not govern practice drills, where the owner is the one being questioned; the [agent vocabulary](agent-vocabulary.md) separates the two senses. The [harness binding](grilling-harness-binding.md) maps the rules below onto each harness's tool.

## Rules

1. **Exhaust the independent paths first.** Read the repository before asking; a question the code, a policy, or the Git history already answers must not be asked. Reading is the floor, not the whole obligation. Take a bounded assumption when it is reversible, low risk, and unlikely to diverge from the owner's intent, and state what you assumed. Finish every part of the task that does not depend on the answer before raising the question, so the owner is settling one decision rather than unblocking a stalled session. What survives all of that is a question where proceeding on any assumption would be unsafe, irreversible, or would make the delivered work useless if the assumption were wrong — and that is the question this policy exists to shape.
2. **Two to four substantive options,** mutually exclusive, together covering the realistic decision space. Fewer than two is a yes-or-no confirmation, not a decision; more than four means the space was never pruned.
3. **Each option states its own trade-off** in one sentence, specific to this decision. "Simpler" is not a trade-off.
4. **Exactly one option is marked Recommended,** in that option's own label rather than by its position in the list, and with a reason grounded in repository state or a stated constraint. The [harness binding](grilling-harness-binding.md) owns the form the mark takes, because a mark the owner has to infer is one they can read past. Recommending nothing withholds the judgment the question exists to supply; recommending two is the same evasion in disguise.
5. **One decision per question.** Batch only decisions where one answer constrains the other. Unrelated decisions are separate questions.
6. **Use the harness's native question tool** when the session is interactive, and the Markdown fallback only when it is not.
7. **A write-in answer counts as much as a listed option.** When it opens a new branch, grill that branch before proceeding.
8. **Every question carries two standing options** beyond its substantive ones: a blank-state write-in, and a "chat about this" path that drops the options and discusses the decision in prose. These are escape hatches, not branches, so they do not count toward the cap. A harness whose list holds only four entries cannot show four substantive options and both escapes; there, prune to three substantive options rather than drop an escape, because a question with no way out is worse than a question with one fewer answer.

## Validation

A drafted question is checked before it is asked; [validation](grilling-with-options-policy/validation.md) holds the checklist and what makes a question invalid.

## Verification

No check can read a question asked at runtime, so this policy is verified in review, like the [task tracking policy](task-tracking-policy.md). What is checkable is that every harness exposes the `grill-me` skill; the [harness capability parity policy](harness-capability-parity-policy.md) owns that.
