# Rules Quality Gate

## Purpose

Find and resolve the ways written guidance decays: two documents that contradict each other, one rule stated in three
places, a reference to something that no longer exists, and a harness that never received a rule the others did.

## When to Use

Run it on demand — after a large rule change, when a contradiction is suspected, or periodically to check drift. It is
deliberately not mandatory: [rules-propagation](rules/rules-propagation.md) integrates one rule correctly on its own,
and gating every one-line edit behind a full corpus review would make small corrections expensive enough to skip.

Running the gate needs no plan, but resolving a finding can. Create a plan for a rule change only when the owner
explicitly requests one; the [plans organization policy](../conventions/plans-organization-policy.md) owns that
authorization boundary and the `rules-fixer` exemption.

## Prerequisites

A clean working tree, or a change complete enough to review as a whole. Choose a severity level; the gate reuses the
levels defined for the [plan quality gate](plan-quality-gate/01-severity-and-modes.md), and strict is the default.

## Steps

1. Establish the corpus; see [scope and corpus](rules-quality-gate/01-scope-and-corpus.md).
2. Run the [Harness Alignment](harness-alignment.md) workflow as a step. It owns the harness inventory, the command and
   path verification, and the parity comparison, and this gate invokes it rather than restating it.
3. Run `rules-checker` over the corpus. It reports findings by severity against the
   [finding taxonomy](rules-quality-gate/02-finding-taxonomy.md), citing `file:line`.
4. Run `rules-fixer` on the findings at or above the chosen level; see the
   [check and fix loop](rules-quality-gate/03-check-fix-loop.md) and the
   [fixer discipline](rules-quality-gate/04-fixer-discipline.md) it runs before each edit lands. A run that found
   nothing skips this step but does not end the gate: one clean run can mean a checker that stopped early rather than a
   corpus that is sound.
5. Re-run `rules-checker`. Repeat until two consecutive runs are clean at that level, or seven cycles have passed.
6. Record the outcome; see the [findings report](rules-quality-gate/05-findings-report.md).

## Verification

```sh
npm run format:check
npm run check:governance
npm run check:harness-parity
npm run check:markdown-links
```

Every check passes, and two consecutive `rules-checker` runs report nothing at the chosen level. The parity check
matters most after a run: `rules-fixer` may edit harness prompts, and parity is the only automated proof it left the
harnesses equal.

## Recovery

See [recovery](rules-quality-gate/07-recovery.md) for what to do when a contradiction is found, and when the loop
reaches seven cycles.
