# Rules Propagation Details

Detail behind the [rules-propagation](../rules-propagation.md) workflow. Filenames are numbered; the
[document naming policy](../../../conventions/document-naming-policy.md) says why.

## Contents

- [Inventory](01-inventory.md) — where to search for guidance that the rule may already touch.
- [Canonical Home](02-canonical-home.md) — which location owns a rule, by the kind of rule it is.
- [Conflict Resolution](03-conflict-resolution.md) — merging overlapping rules, and what to do with a contradiction.
- [Idempotency Gate](04-idempotency-gate.md) — the objective criteria that stop a run without changing an already-clear
  rule.
