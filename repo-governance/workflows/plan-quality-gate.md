# Plan Quality Gate

## Purpose

Validate that a plan is complete, accurate, and executable against the current repository, then fix what is not. The
gate exists because a plan is executed literally: an ambiguous checkbox does not produce a question at execution time,
it produces a wrong action.

## When to Use

Use it after [plan-planning](plan-planning.md) authors a plan, after any edit to a plan under `backlog/` or
`in-progress/`, and before [plan-execution](plan-execution.md) begins. A plan that has never passed this gate is not
ready to start.

## Prerequisites

The plan exists with all five core documents and has been through the
[structural review](plan-planning/04-structural-review.md). Choose a severity level; see
[severity and modes](plan-quality-gate/01-severity-and-modes.md). Strict is the default.

## Steps

1. Run `plan-checker` against the plan folder. It reads every document, applies
   [Minimum Sufficiency](../principles/minimum-sufficiency.md), and reports findings by severity, citing `file:line`;
   see the [check and fix loop](plan-quality-gate/02-check-fix-loop.md).
2. Skip the next step if no finding meets the chosen level. A clean run does not end the gate; step 5 says what does.
3. Run `plan-fixer` on the findings at or above that level. It edits the plan documents only; it never touches the code
   the plan describes, and it runs the [fixer discipline](rules-quality-gate/04-fixer-discipline.md) before each edit
   lands.
4. Re-run `plan-checker`. A fix that introduced a new finding is caught here rather than at execution.
5. Repeat until two consecutive runs report nothing at the chosen level, or seven cycles have passed.
6. Record the outcome in the plan's `README.md`: the level used, the cycles run, and the final status; see the
   [findings report](plan-quality-gate/04-findings-report.md).

## Verification

The gate passes when two consecutive `plan-checker` runs report no finding at the chosen level. One clean run is not
enough: a single pass can reflect a checker that stopped early rather than a plan that is sound.

## Loop Bounds

Two consecutive clean runs end the loop. Seven cycles end it too, with the remaining findings reported. Cycle five
raises a warning: a plan still finding new problems that late is usually structurally wrong rather than imprecise.

## Recovery

If the loop reaches seven cycles, stop and read the remaining findings yourself. Repeated failure to converge usually
means the plan's approach is wrong rather than its wording, and `plan-fixer` cannot fix an approach. Rewrite the
affected phase through [plan-planning](plan-planning.md) instead of iterating further.

If `plan-fixer` changes the meaning of a decision rather than its expression, revert that edit and resolve the decision
with the owner. The fixer's mandate is clarity, not authority.
