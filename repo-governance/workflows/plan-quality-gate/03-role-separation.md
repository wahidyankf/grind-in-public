# Role Separation

Separating the roles keeps the checker honest. A single agent that both finds and fixes has an incentive to find only
what it can fix, and the findings it cannot fix are the ones that matter most.

The [check and fix loop](02-check-fix-loop.md) divides the work between the two roles, and states what each may and may
not do. The parent [workflow](../plan-quality-gate.md#loop-bounds) owns the loop bounds and recovery guidance.
