# Maintenance Value

Every maintained line and tool surface is a liability. Before adding code, scripts, commands, tooling, automation, or
configuration, prove that a recurring concrete benefit exceeds its implementation, review, execution, documentation,
debugging, upgrade, and removal costs. Also prove that an existing mechanism or a clear manual step cannot satisfy the
need. If either case is unproven, do not add the surface.

Prefer deleting, simplifying, or reusing over creating. Do not automate a rare action merely because it can be
automated, duplicate an executable rule as metadata, or create a repository command for a check whose false confidence
or upkeep costs more than running the underlying standard tool directly.

Review the net value again when a surface grows or its original need disappears. Passing tests prove behavior, not that
the behavior deserves permanent maintenance.

[Minimum Sufficiency](minimum-sufficiency.md) governs the scope and stopping point of every task; this principle
independently tests whether a maintained surface earns its recurring cost. Apply both.
