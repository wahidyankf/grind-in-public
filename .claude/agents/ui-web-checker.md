  Audits a running web user interface against its specification, adopted design, accessibility beyond what a scanner settles, and first-use usability, and returns criticality-rated findings with reproduction steps, without modifying anything. Use as the checker of a UI web quality gate cycle, once the interface is reachable and its specification resolves.
