# Claude Code Skills

Claude Code discovers these skills automatically from this directory. It ignores this README; the
[agent harness support policy](../../repo-governance/conventions/agent-harness-support.md) records that behaviour.

## Available Skills

- [`grill-me/`](grill-me/SKILL.md) — resolves open decisions by asking the owner structured multiple-choice questions.
  Use it when work is blocked on a decision, or when the owner asks to be grilled on a design.

Each skill is mirrored in [`.agents/skills/`](../../.agents/skills/README.md) and must stay at parity. opencode reads
both directories, so it needs no third copy; see the
[harness capability parity policy](../../repo-governance/conventions/harness-capability-parity-policy.md).
