# Documentation

This directory contains human-facing documentation for Grind in Public: learning material, exercise guidance, and
project concepts. AI-agent instructions belong in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and related instruction files. Shared
rules and governance procedures apply to people and agents, and belong in [`repo-governance/`](../repo-governance/).

## Diátaxis

Organize documentation by the reader's need, using the four Diátaxis forms:

| Form         | Reader need       | Use for                            | Location                                |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Tutorial     | Learning          | A guided first experience          | [`tutorials/`](tutorials/README.md)     |
| How-to guide | Completing a task | Goal-oriented directions           | [`how-to/`](how-to/README.md)           |
| Reference    | Looking up facts  | Accurate conventions and facts     | [`reference/`](reference/README.md)     |
| Explanation  | Understanding     | Rationale, trade-offs, and context | [`explanation/`](explanation/README.md) |

For example, a lesson that teaches a problem-solving pattern is a tutorial; instructions for recording a drill are a
how-to guide; an exercise directory convention is reference; and the reasoning behind hands-on practice is explanation.

Each section includes a README that defines its purpose. Add new documents to the section that best answers the reader's
question, and link them from this index as the collection grows.

## Available Guides

- [Run the Nx Workspace](how-to/run-nx-workspace.md) explains how to build, test, and run the workspace's TypeScript
  demonstration app.
