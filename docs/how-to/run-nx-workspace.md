# Run the Nx Workspace

Use this guide to build, test, or lint the workspace after installing the repository's dependencies.

## Prerequisites

From the repository root, install the pinned dependency tree:

```sh
rtk ./hippo run --class transactional --disk-path . -- npm install
```

## Build and Test

Build every project, then run the cacheable ordered quick gate:

```sh
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run build
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run test:quick
```

For every project, `test:quick` runs type-checking, linting, deterministic unit tests, and native coverage enforcement
in that order. Coverage must reach at least 95% aggregate statements. Run a stage independently when narrowing a
failure:

```sh
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run typecheck
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run lint
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run test:unit
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run test:coverage
```

`npm test` is an alias for `npm run test:quick`.

## Run Integration Tests

Run real cross-project checks separately when needed:

```sh
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run test:integration
```

Integration tests are not part of the pre-push hook.

## Run the Repository Checks

Run these checks after changing the agent instruction files, `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, Markdown files under
`repo-governance/`, anything under `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, or `.opencode/`, or a project's `project.json` or
`nx.json`:

```sh
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run check:governance
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run check:harness-parity
rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm run check:markdown-links
```

What each of these checks enforces is stated once in
[workspace commands](../../repo-governance/development/workspace-commands.md#repository-checks), together with a fifth
command, `npm run check:rule-change`, that this guide does not run. Which hook runs each one, and on which pushes, is
listed in the same reference under [hooks](../../repo-governance/development/workspace-commands.md#hooks). The
rule-change and link commands read Git-tracked files, so `git add -N <file>` a new document before trusting a local run.

Before each push, Nx compares every pushed local commit with `origin/main` and runs cached `test:quick` only for
affected projects under `apps/` and `libs/`. See the shared
[testing policy](../../repo-governance/development/testing-policy.md) for the target rules.

Nx discovers the projects from their `project.json` files. Inspect them with
`rtk ./hippo run --class ephemeral --disk-path . -- npm exec -- nx show projects`. This repository uses only raw Nx
command targets; see the [Nx workspace policy](../../repo-governance/development/nx-workspace-policy.md) before adding
Nx tooling, and [Target Shape](../../repo-governance/development/testing-policy/target-shape.md) for what a target
declares.
