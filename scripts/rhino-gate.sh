# The documentation hygiene gate, against one already resolved release.
#
# It exists because the alternative is six `./rhino` invocations, and resolving
# the pinned release is not free: each one takes the shared install guard,
# digests the cached executable, and asks it for its embedded identity in a
# subprocess. Six of those serialize against each other and cost more than the
# checking does. `./rhino --bootstrap-exec` pays it once and names the verified
# executable in `RHINO_BIN`.
#
# This file owns which checks run and in what combination. It owns nothing
# about what any of them mean: the policy is in `repo-config.yml`.
set -u

# Reading this variable is the whole contract with the bootstrap. Running the
# checks without one would mean running an executable nobody verified.
